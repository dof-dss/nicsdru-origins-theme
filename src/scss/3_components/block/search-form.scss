// Search forms
//
// At its most basic level, a search form comprises 2 elements an input and a submit button, they are normally wrapped
// by a form tag. This is common for all search forms on the site and can easily by targeted with css to retain a level
// of consistency - therefore a search form component should have the `.search-form` class added to the form wrapper. A
// modifier class is then used to apply contextual attributes.
//
// Style guide: components.search-form
